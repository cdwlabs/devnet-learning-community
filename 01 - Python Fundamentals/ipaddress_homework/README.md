# ipaddress Code Samples

These code samples are an overview of basic Python coding and an introduction to the ipaddress standard library module. They progress from simple text operations to reading and writing text files. Each file includes items that need to be corrected for the script to execute correctly. These are noted with ***<EDIT_THIS>*** in place of the missing code.

ipaddress_1_output.py - Simple overview of printing output.

ipaddress_2_host_main.py - Summary of function structure, `__name__`, and main().

ipaddress_3_variables.py - Quick review of common ipaddress module features for ip_address and ip_network. Real validation of an address in a network.

ipaddress_4_lists.py - Checking a list of addresses for membership in a network.

ipaddress_5_read_text.py - Loading a list of host addresses and networks from files and checking membership.

ipaddress_6_multi_list.py - Loading text files for hosts and networks and returning which networks the hosts belong to. Also writing this information out to a file.
