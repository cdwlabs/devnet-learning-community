# Fortune Code Samples

These code samples are from the overview session. They progress from simple text operations to processing text and CSV files. The final  contains most of the code for all samples. Each new concept includes external references for more information.

fortunes_1_basic.py - Simple overview of file structure, variables, functions, and printing output.

fortunes_2_sub_options.py - Overview of string substitution options and evolution in Python. (%s, .format, f-strings)

fortunes_3_old.py - Full Python 2 string substitution example with % notation. Don't write like this, but you **need** to be able to read it.

fortunes_4_sub_format.py - String substitution with .format. New with Python 3 but f-strings are easier to read in most cases.

fortunes_5_sub_format_mapped.py - String substitution with parameter mapping to improve readability. Better readability, but clumsy to write.

fortunes_6_sub_fstrings.py - String substitution with f-strings. Often the most readable format, but it requires Python 3.6 or newer.

fortunes_7_files_text.py - Opening and reading data from text files.

fortunes_8_files_csv.py - Opening and reading CSV files. Using a column in the CSV to filter fortunes returned.

fortunes_9_notes.py - Full code overview with extensive external references for most concepts.
