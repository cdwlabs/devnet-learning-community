## Presentation Code (/fortune_code)
This repository contains the code presented during the session in the fortune_code directory. This includes all the code discussed during the session. These examples are all highly modified versions of sample code from the CiscoLive session DEVNET-1893. This slide deck can be found on the [CiscoLive](https://ciscolive.com) site.

Additional resources on introductory Python training can be found here:
 - [Introduction to DevNet](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/tracks/devnet-beginner), specifically the Intro to Python sections.
 - [Python Institute - Python Essentials](https://pythoninstitute.org/free-python-courses/)

## Homework Code (/ipaddress_homework)
There is also a directory with homework for reading Python code. There are some substitutions required to get the code to run correctly. The focus of these activities is building a functional Python script.

The code uses the [ipaddress module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html) from the Python standard library. These exercises just scratch the surface of what's possible with the ipaddress module though. An in depth overview of the module can be found here:
